# Machine-Learning-Models

This repository contains a collection of practical labs and implementations of machine learning models developed as part of an academic course.

##  Objective

To explore and understand core machine learning algorithms through hands-on exercises using Python and standard data science libraries.

##  Contents

Each lab folder includes datasets, source code, visualizations, and explanatory comments describing the logic behind each model.

### Implemented Models:
- Linear and Polynomial Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forests  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)  
- Basic Neural Networks  
- Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN)

## Tools Used

- Python 3  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
